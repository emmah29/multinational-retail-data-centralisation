# Multinational Retail Data Centralisation

To start off your README.md, I’d start by introducing the project, describing what it does and listing the technologies (python, Teachable Machine, random library) involved in the project and why you used them i.e., the random library for generating the computer’s choice in the game.

## Description
I don't know yet ;-)

What was your motivation? Why did you build this project?
What problem does it solve?
Why did you make the decisions you made in creating your solution?
What did you learn?
What makes your project stand out?
If your project has a lot of different features, consider adding a "Features" section and listing them here


## Installation

If your project is a piece of software, like an application or a package that others might download and use, you should provide detailed instructions on how to get your project running on the reader's local environment. This could include information on necessary software, environment setup, installation of dependencies, and any final steps needed to get the project up and running.

## Usage

It is also helpful to give a walkthrough or guide to your project in action. If your repository is a data project, this would be the section where you present your key findings, or it is a piece of software that others might want to use, it should show examples of how to use it. This could include code snippets, command line instructions, screenshots, gifs or videos. The goal here is to demonstrate the value of your project by showing it in action. If your project is a library, then a list of the available functions would go in this section, possibly alongside some worked examples.
